# Isometric-Minecraft
*A Minecraft add-on which allows the world to be seen without (much) depth.*

Automatically gives all players **isometric:flip** and **isometric:zoom**. Drop these items to change/freeze the camera angle and zoom.

**You won't lose these items even without /keepinventory.** Aiming at enemies (and moving in general) is quite hard, all players have **Strength 2** *(Strength 1 when zoomed)* to balance this. Additionally, a particle shows where you're currently aiming. You may also turn on Aim Assist *(in Experimental Options)* to get a 90° cone aim assist with 4.5 entity reach.

To turn off the mod, type */tag @s add iso_off*.

**This add-on works best with your FOV set to 30°.**

*Tested and mainly developed on a touchscreen device.*
